******** SETUP INSTRUCTIONS FOR THE BELL MEDIA TEST *********************

1) In your command line or terminal, navigate to the root directory, in this case: belltest.

2) Make sure that node.js is installed in you computer, so that you can have the global command "npm".

3) Type and run the command: `npm install`, also make sure that the internet is available, 
    because it will now download all the dependencies.  If you encounter any errors, make sure
    the errors are resolved, else the app might not load. 

4) Make sure that you have gulp installed globally in your computer, if not, run the command:
    `npm install -g gulp` If you don't have gulp installed, when you run the step that follows, it will complain that gulp is not found. 
    
5) run the command `gulp` and it will run the server that will display the web application, and once that 
   is successful, it will confirm and also say what it is running on localhost:3000.
   
6) Open your favourite browser and type in the web address :  localhost:3000    

7) You can now browse the web application. There are two pages in this app:  the Home page that is just an introduction
    and the "Players" page that displays the tables.
